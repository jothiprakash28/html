   <p>Emory Andrew Tate III (born December 1, 1986) is a British and American social media personality, <br>businessman, and former professional kickboxer.
    
    Tate began practicing kickboxing in 2005 and gained his first championship in 2009.<br> He attracted wider attention in 2016, when he appeared on the British reality show Big Brother and was removed after his comments on social media attracted controversy. He began offering paid courses and memberships through his website and rose to fame as an internet celebrity, promoting an "ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle". Tate's misogynistic commentary has resulted in his suspension from several social media platforms.[4][5][6][7]
